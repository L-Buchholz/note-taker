# Note-Taker

## Bootcamp homework

A business owner requires an interactive application that enables them to write and save notes pertaining to work ideas and tasks. The following "Acceptance Criteria" for this feature were requested and have now been implemented:

- When the _Note Taker_ application is opened, user is presented with a landing page with a clickable link to the notes page
- When opened, the notes page displays:
  - Existing notes (left-hand column)
  - Empty field to enter a new note title (right-hand column)
  - Empty field to enter the new note's text (right-hand column)
- New note titles and texts can be saved (via an icon in the navigation bar) once data has been entered into those fields
  - These new notes are saved in the left-hand column
- When clicked, an existing note in the left-hand column appears in the right-hand column
- The "Write" icon (nav bar) is clickable and presents the user with empty fields to enter a new note title and text (right-hand column)

As a component of this assignment:

- The pre-built front end application connects to an Express.js back end
- The application has been deployed to Heroku
- All entered values ("notes") have unique JSON file ID's

Additionally, there are no errors in the console when it is inspected using Chrome DevTools and the Javascript includes comments.
